# Course of python programming basics

I took this course when I decided to start learning python.
It contains many tasks on basic principles, data structures and algorithms.

This repository contains my solutions for almost all tasks from the course.
Solutions may not be well-formed, not optimal, slow, etc., since at that time I was just starting my way as a programmer. 
Decisions are laid out by weeks, as in the course. Tasks without conditions, but by the name or by the code it is quite possible to understand what the problem is.
